# CSCI2270Project
Final Project for CSCI2270

Project Summary
This program creates a graph of the Boulder B Cycle bike sharing stations. Then it provides tools to help the user in their quest to visit all stations in one day (the Tour de B Cycle!). These tools include: listing all stations, find the nearest five stations, creating a route based on the nearest neighbor algorithm, finding the best station to start at, and listing the distances to other stations. 

How to Run
Place all the files in the same directory.
Compile by running: g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Graph.cpp
Then run with: ./a.out bcycleStations.txt
Now the user can decide which options they want to run in the main menu.
