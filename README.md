# CSCI2270Project
Final Project for CSCI2270

In this project we create a graph of the Boulder B Cycle bike sharing program. Then we'll implement some of the graph related algorithms learn in this class as well as attempting to solve the most efficient way to visit all stations (Tour de B cycle)

Teammates:
Richard Laub
